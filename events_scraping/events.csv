It&rsquo;s IMdB summary reads:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">&ldquo;To say that you played a hand double dummy is the highest compliment that you can pay a bridge player. It means to play the hand as if you know where all the cards are. This film is a celebration of the card game bridge.

It is a vibrant game played and loved by people of all ages and a great pastime.&rdquo;</span></p>

With it&rsquo;s under an hour runtime, and its explanations designed to be understandable for those not familiar with bridge, it makes a nice addition to a Saturday night and one&rsquo;s overall bridge knowledge.</span></p>
